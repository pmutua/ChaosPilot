# My Journey in the Google Agent Development Kit Hackathon: Building ChaosPilot

## Introduction
Participating in the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) Hackathon was a transformative experience. My project, ChaosPilot, was born out of a real-world need for smarter, AI-powered log analysis—a pain point I'd encountered in both professional and personal projects. This blog chronicles my journey, from the initial spark of inspiration to the technical hurdles, breakthroughs, and the lessons learned along the way.

## The Spark: Why ChaosPilot?
The idea for ChaosPilot came from countless hours spent sifting through logs, trying to diagnose issues in cloud environments. I was inspired by stories on Reddit and my own frustrations with existing tools. I envisioned an autonomous agent system that could not only detect issues but also recommend fixes, plan actions, and even notify stakeholders—all powered by the latest advances in AI and cloud technology.

## Day 1: Diving into the Agent Development Kit
The hackathon kicked off with an introduction to Google's Agent Development Kit. The learning curve was steep—understanding the ADK's architecture, capabilities, and how to integrate it with my own backend. I spent the first day experimenting with the ADK, reading documentation, and sketching out the architecture for ChaosPilot.

## Building the Stack
I chose a modern, full-stack approach:
- **Backend:** Python, leveraging the Google ADK, FastAPI, and integrations with Google Cloud (BigQuery, Logging API).
- **Frontend:** Angular, TypeScript, and SCSS for a responsive UI.
- **Authentication & Database:** Supabase for secure user management and PostgreSQL storage.
- **AI/ML:** Azure OpenAI for LLM and embeddings, with all sensitive operations handled securely on the backend.
- **DevOps:** Docker for containerization, batch/shell scripts for deployment.

## Early Wins and First Roadblocks
Getting the basic agent workflow running was exhilarating. I quickly set up the backend to ingest logs, chunk data, and store it securely. However, integrating the ADK with my own logic and ensuring secure, efficient communication between the frontend and backend proved challenging. I had to be meticulous about not exposing API keys, following best practices for data sanitization, and keeping all AI calls on the backend.

## The UI Challenge: Making AI Understandable
One of the biggest hurdles was the frontend. I wanted users to see not just plain text, but also structured data, tables, and even agent handoffs in real time. This meant:
- Updating the Angular chat service to robustly parse and display all response types (text, markdown, JSON, function calls).
- Designing UI components for quick actions, loading animations, and multi-step workflows.
- Ensuring the dashboard was secure, with Supabase authentication and route guards.

## Debugging, Iterating, and Learning
There were moments of frustration—especially when responses weren't rendering correctly, or when authentication flows broke after a deployment. Each bug was a learning opportunity. I leaned heavily on documentation, community forums, and the hackathon's Slack channel. The iterative process of coding, testing, and refining taught me the value of resilience and adaptability.

## The Breakthroughs
The most satisfying moments came when everything clicked:
- The UI finally rendered all agent responses, including markdown and structured JSON.
- Quick action buttons worked seamlessly, triggering backend workflows and displaying results instantly.
- The dashboard was locked down, ensuring only authenticated users could access sensitive data.

## Final Touches: Documentation and Storytelling
As the hackathon deadline approached, I focused on polish:
- Writing a clear, professional README and a personal STORY.md to showcase my journey and the project's value.
- Creating a STACKS.md to highlight the technical depth and modern stack.
- Ensuring the deployment process was smooth and well-documented.

## Reflections and Takeaways
This hackathon was more than just a coding sprint—it was a deep dive into autonomous agent systems, secure cloud integration, and user-centric design. I learned:
- The power of agent-based architectures for real-world automation.
- The importance of security and best practices when handling sensitive data and AI APIs.
- How to communicate technical complexity in a way that's accessible to users and future employers.

## What's Next?
ChaosPilot is just the beginning. I'm excited to continue exploring agent-based systems, cloud automation, and AI-driven developer tools. The skills and insights gained from this hackathon will shape my future projects—and, hopefully, inspire others to build smarter, more autonomous solutions.
