ðŸš€ Just wrapped up the Google Agent Development Kit Hackathon! ðŸš€

Proud to present **ChaosPilot**: an AI-powered log analysis platform that leverages autonomous agents to detect, plan, fix, and notify about cloud issuesâ€”built with Angular, Python, Google ADK, Supabase, and Azure OpenAI.

This journey was packed with learning: from integrating agent-based systems and securing cloud APIs, to building a modern, user-friendly UI and overcoming real-world deployment challenges.

Big thanks to Google, the ADK team, and the hackathon community for the inspiration and support!
