## 2025-06-22 ‚Äî Session Journal

### ‚úÖ Dependency Management Modernization
- Added and documented usage of `uv` for fast, modern Python dependency management.
- Provided clear instructions for installing dependencies, locking them (`uv.lock`), and installing optional groups.
- Added guidance for using `hatch` and virtual environments, including best practices for not mixing environment managers.
- Updated `QUICK_START.md` to reflect all of the above.

### ‚úÖ Tools and Toolsets Refactor
- Refactored `mcp-toolbox/tools.yaml` to:
  - Use only fields present in the actual BigQuery schema (no more references to non-existent fields).
  - Move all tool definitions under the `tools:` section, with toolsets as lists of tool names under `toolsets:`.
  - Fixed YAML structure errors (mapping vs. sequence) so Toolbox loads without error.
  - Ensured all toolsets (`detector_toolset`, `planner_toolset`, `action_recommender_toolset`) are schema-compliant and functional.

### ‚úÖ Agent Code Modernization
- Refactored `agent_manager/agent.py` to:
  - Use the async ADK Runtime pattern (`async def main()`, `await session_service.create_session`, `async for event in runner.run_async(...)`).
  - Remove legacy synchronous helpers (like `run_local_query`).
  - Ensure all session and event handling is fully async and ADK-compliant.
- Verified that all sub-agents (detector, planner, action_recommender) only use schema-compliant fields.

### ‚úÖ Documentation Improvements
- Added clear, step-by-step quick start for:
  - Using `uv` and `hatch` for dependency management.
  - Running the project with or without a virtual environment.
  - Best practices for environment management.
  - How to install dependencies globally (not recommended for production).
- Clarified that the project does **not** use the ADK CLI for running the agent, but rather standard Python entry points.

### ‚úÖ Error Fixes and Troubleshooting
- Fixed YAML parsing errors in `tools.yaml` by correcting toolset structure.
- Fixed async/sync issues in agent code (e.g., coroutine not awaited, attribute errors).
- Provided schema-compliant queries for all toolsets, ensuring all BigQuery queries run without missing field errors.

## 2025-06-24 ‚Äî Full-Stack AI Log Analysis & UI Integration Session

### üöÄ Major Achievements
- **End-to-End Integration:** Successfully integrated the Angular frontend with the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) backend, enabling seamless, secure, and robust communication between UI and AI agents.
- **Quick Action Workflow:** Implemented and visually refined all quick action buttons (Analyze Error Logs, Classify Incident, Generate Fix Plan, Recommend Fixes, Correlate Logs, Performance Review) to trigger backend agent workflows and display results in a user-friendly, dynamic UI.
- **Dynamic Response Rendering:**
  - Built a flexible chat UI that parses and renders both markdown and structured JSON data from multiple agent types.
  - Added logic to display agent handoffs, function calls, and function responses (including tables for structured data and formatted markdown reports).
  - Ensured the UI can handle complex, multi-step agent workflows and display results clearly for both technical and non-technical users.
- **Authentication & Security:**
  - Enforced Supabase authentication for all sensitive routes (dashboard, chat, history, settings).
  - Verified that only logged-in users can access the dashboard and other protected areas, redirecting unauthenticated users to the landing page.
- **UX Improvements:**
  - Added loading animations and disabled states for chat/submit buttons.
  - Provided clear feedback for agent handoffs and multi-agent workflows.
  - Ensured accessibility and responsiveness across the UI.

### üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** Angular, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, RxJS
- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, Google ADK, async/await patterns
- **Authentication:** Supabase (user management, session handling)
- **Data/AI:** Google ADK agents (detector, planner, fixer, action_recommender, notifier), BigQuery analytics
- **DevOps:** Modern Python dependency management (`uv`, `hatch`), Docker, GCP

### üí° Technical Highlights
- Demonstrated advanced TypeScript and Angular skills by building a robust, modular, and reactive UI.
- Implemented secure, scalable authentication and route protection using Supabase and Angular guards.
- Designed and debugged complex agent workflows, handling diverse response types (plain text, markdown, JSON, multi-agent handoff).
- Built dynamic UI components for rendering structured data, including auto-generated tables and summary cards.
- Practiced best practices in async Python, API design, and frontend-backend contract alignment.
- Maintained clear, future-proof documentation and project journaling for team transparency and onboarding.

## Summary
- Today's work demonstrates full-stack proficiency, rapid problem-solving, and a strong focus on user experience, security, and maintainability.
- The project is now a showcase of modern AI-driven log analysis, with a professional, extensible UI and secure, scalable backend.
